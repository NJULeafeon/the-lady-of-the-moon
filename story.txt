The story of Chang'e is a miserable story.
Long long ago,
a hero Hou Yi and his wife Chang'e lived a happy life.
One day,
the Western Queen gave Hou Yi two elixirs in honor of the hero's efforts to help the public.
The person who eat just ont elixir can be immortal,
and who eat two will become a celestial being but leave the earth, living a lonely life and can never get back again.
Hou Yi asked Chang'e to preserve the elixir in order to be immortal with his wife, Chang'e one of these days.
A few days later,
Hou Yi went out for a hunting.
A bad guy Peng Meng who got the secret from somewhere took the chance to break into Hou Yi's house and intended to rob Chang'e of the elixirs.
In order to protect the pills from the bad guy,
Chang'e ate both of the pills, regardless of the terrible outcome.
As a result,
she had no choice but to be sent to the moon.
Though she became immortal,
she lost her beloved husband forever.
Chang'e's lonliness on the moon emphasized people of being seperated from relatives,
so people tend to gather together with their families in the Mid-autumn Festival, watch the moon and retell the upsetting story from generation to feneration.
