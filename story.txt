The well-known Chinese legend of Chang'e is really miserable.
Long long ago,
a hero Hou Yi and his wife Chang'e lived a happy life.
One day,
the Western Queen gave Hou Yi two elixirs in honor of the hero's efforts to help the public.
The person who eat just ont elixir can be immortal,
and who eat two will become a celestial being but leave the earth, to live a lonely life and never get back again.
Hou Yi asked Chang'e to preserve the elixirs in order to be immortal with her one day.
A few days later,
Hou Yi went out for a hunting.
An evil guy Peng Meng who got the secret from somewhere took the chance to break into Hou Yi's house and intended to rob Chang'e of the elixirs.
In order to protect the elixirs from the evil guy,
Chang'e ate both of the elixirs, regardless of the terrible outcome.
As a result,
she unwillingly flew to the moon.
Though she became immortal,
she parted from her beloved husband forever and lived lonely on the moon since then.
Chang'e's loneliness on the moon reminds people of the misery of being seperated from relatives,
so people tend to gather together with their families on the Mid-autumn Festival,
watch the moon and pass the upsetting story from generations to generations.
