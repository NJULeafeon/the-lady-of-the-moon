The story of Chang'e is a miserable story.
Long long ago,
a hero Hou Yi and his wife Chang'e lived a happy life.
One day,
the West Queen gave Hou Yi two elixir in honor to the hero's feat.
The person who eat the elixir can be immortal,
and who eat two will become a celestial being but leave the earth, living a lonely life.
Hou Yi asked Chang'e to keep the elixir in order to be immortal with his wife, Chang'e one day.
A few days later,
Hou Yi went out for a hunting.
A bad guy called Peng Meng who got the secret from somewhere took the chance to rob Chang'e of the elixirs.
In order to protect the pills from the bad guy,
Chang'e ate all the two pills, regardless of the terrible outcome.
As a result,
she went to the moon forever.
Though she became immortal,
she lost her beloved husband forever.
Chang'e's lonliness on the moon reminds people of the misery of being seperated from relatives,
so people will gather in the Mid-autumn Festival, watch the moon and retell the upsetting story from generation to feneration.
