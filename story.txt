The story of Chang'e is a miserable story.
Long Long ago,
Hou Yi and his wife Chang'e lived a happy life.
One day,
the West Queen gave Hou Yi two elixir.
The person who eat the elixir can be immortal,
but who eat two will become a celestial being and leave the earth.
How Yi hided the elixir in order to be immortal with his wife, Chang'e one day.
Another day,
Hou Yi wet out to hunt.
A bad guy called Peng Meng who got the secret from somewhere intended to rob Chang'e of the elixirs.
In order to protect the pills from the bad guy,
she ate all the two pills.
As a result,
she went to the moon forever.
Though she became immortal,
she lost her beloved husband forever.
Chang'e's lonliness on the moon reminds people of the misery of being seperated from relatives,
so people gather and watch the moon and retell the upsetting story.
