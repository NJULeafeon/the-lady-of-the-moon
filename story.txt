The story of Chang'e is a miserable story.
Long long ago,
a hero Hou Yi and his wife Chang'e lived a happy life.
One day,
the West Queen gave Hou Yi two elixirs in honor of the hero's feat.
The person who eat one elixir can be immortal,
and who eat two will become a celestial being and leave the earth, to live a lonely life.
Hou Yi asked Chang'e to keep the elixirs in order to be immortal with her one day.
A few days later,
Hou Yi went out for a hunting.
A bad guy called Peng Meng who got the secret from somewhere took the chance to rob Chang'e of the elixirs.
In order to protect the elixirs from the bad guy,
Chang'e ate all the two elixirs, regardless of the terrible outcome.
As a result,
she went to the moon forever.
Though she became immortal,
she parted with her beloved husband forever and lived all alone one the moon since then.
Chang'e's lonliness on the moon reminds people of the misery of being seperated from relatives,
so people will gather in the Mid-autumn Festival, watch the moon and retell the upsetting story from generations to generations.
